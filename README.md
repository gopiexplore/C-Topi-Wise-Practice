<h1>Variables:</h1><br/>

1.Write a program that declares two integer variables and assigns them values. Then, swap the values of the two variables and print their new values.</br>

2.Write a program that declares three float variables and assigns them values. Then, calculate and print the average of the three values.</br>

<h2>Data types:<h2><br/>

3.Write a program that declares and initializes a char array with the value "hello world". Then, print the array to the console.</br>

4.Write a program that declares and initializes a double variable with the value 3.14159. Then, print the variable to the console with 2 decimal places.</br>

<h1>Constants:</h1></br>

5.Write a program that declares a constant integer variable with the value 10. Then, declare another integer variable and assign it the value of the constant variable multiplied by 5. Print the value of the new variable to the console.</br>

6.Write a program that declares a constant float variable with the value 3.14. Then, declare another float variable and assign it the value of the constant variable multiplied by 2. Print the value of the new variable to the console with 2 decimal places.</br>

<h1>Operators:</h1></br>

7.Write a program that declares two integer variables and assigns them values. Then, use the addition operator to add the two variables and print the result to the console.</br>

8.Write a program that declares two float variables and assigns them values. Then, use the division operator to divide the first variable by the second and print the result to the console with 3 decimal places.</br>

<h1>Input/Output (printf, scanf):</h1></br>

9.Write a program that prompts the user to enter their name and age. Then, print a message to the console that says "Hello, [name]. You are [age] years old."</br>

10.Write a program that prompts the user to enter two integer values. Then, use scanf to read in the values and use printf to print their sum to the console.</br>

<h1>Conditional Statements (if, switch):</h1></br>

11.Write a program that prompts the user to enter their age. If their age is greater than or equal to 18, print "You are an adult." Otherwise, print "You are a minor."</br>

12.Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number between 1 and 7. Then, use a switch statement to print the corresponding day of the week to the console.</br>
